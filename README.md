# EK Fight Gym Webpage #
### Project User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute ###

This is my website made to present my second home and favourite place, it details the coaches, classes and contact info.
My idea was to make a webpage to easily display important information that anyone not familiar with the gym 
might want to know.

### Demo ###
A live demo can be found <a href="https://james-stewart110.github.io/milestone-project/">here</a>

### UX ###
<img src="https://github.com/James-Stewart110/milestone-project/blob/master/mockups/ux-image-2.png">

### Users ###
The expected users of this site are Muay Thai fighters, fans or anyone wanting to get information on
the gym and its schedual.

### User Stories ###
1. A person interested in joining wants to know when the classes are on.<br>
2. A fan of the gym wants to know whats happening.<br>
3. A user wants to know more information about the trainors.<br>
4. A fighter wants to check the Facebook feed.<br>

### Design ###
* Colour scheme consisted of:<br>
  * Bootstrap primary colour class - similar blue to gym shorts.<br>
  * Off white background - #f7f7f7 - easier on the eyes than plain white.<br>
  * Bootstrap bg-dark class - contrast to the light background.<br>
* Logo used from gym shorts and Facebook.<br>
* Roboto and Exo fonts used throughout the page.<br>

### Deployment ###
The live site is deployed on <a href="https://james-stewart110.github.io/milestone-project/">GitHub pages.</a>

The process involved:

- Host a git repository on GitHub. Explained here.<br>
- The root folder contains README.md and index.html files<br>
- On GitHub repository settings page move to GitHub Pages section<br>
- Change source to master branch. (Or any desired branch)<br>
- Provided link will be your projects home (index) page.<br>

To deploy your own version of the website:<br>

- Have git installed<br>
- Visit the repository<br>
- Click 'Clone or download' and copy the code for http<br>
- Open your chosen IDE (Gitpod, VS Code, etc.)<br>
- Open a terminal in your root directory<br>
- Type 'git clone ' followed by the code taken from github repository<br>
  - git clone https://github.com/James-Stewart110/milestone-project.git<br>
- When this completes you have your own version of the website<br>
- The website can be run by opening one of the HTML files within a web browser<br>
- Visit the link provided<br>
- Your website with any made changes will appear<br>
- Saved changes to the website will appear here after refreshing the page<br>
- The benefits of hosting your website on GitHub pages is that any pushed changes to your project will automatically update the website. Development branches can be created and merged to the master when complete.<br>

It may take a moment for changes to appear on the hosted website.<br>
