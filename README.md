<h1>EK Fight Gym Webpage</h1>
<h3>Project</h3> User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my website made to present my second home and favourite place, it details the coaches, classes and contact info.
My idea was to make a webpage to easily display important information that anyone not familiar with the gym 
might want to know.
